He was formerly the governor of New York, but resigned in 2008 after it was revealed that he had paid for sex with prostitutes.</p>
<p>While most people know about his high-profile political career, many don’t know that he has a second career as a successful blackjack player. In fact, his net worth is estimated at $16 million, largely from his winnings from playing blackjack.</p>
<p>How did Eliot Spitzer become such a successful blackjack player? It all started in college, when he was introduced to the game by one of his professors. After learning the basics of the game, he began practicing regularly and eventually became quite good at it.</p>
<p>He continued playing blackjack through law school and into his early political career, eventually becoming known as one of the best players in the country. In fact, he’s even been quoted as saying that “blackjack is more than a game; it’s an addiction.”</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone agrees with Eliot Spitzer’s approach to blackjack. Some casino executives have accused him of using illegal techniques to gain an advantage over the house. However, Spitzer has always denied any allegations of cheating and insists that he’s just a very good player who knows how to take advantage of the odds.</p>
<p>Whatever you may think of Eliot Spitzer, there’s no denying that he’s been phenomenally successful at blackjack. His experience playing the game has taught him a lot about risk management and decision making, which has come in handy during his political career.</p>
<h1 id="Eliot-Spitzer-mansion-up-for-sale-mystery-surrounds-blackjack-earnings"><a href="#Eliot-Spitzer-mansion-up-for-sale-mystery-surrounds-blackjack-earnings" class="headerlink" title="Eliot Spitzer mansion up for sale, mystery surrounds blackjack earnings"></a>Eliot Spitzer mansion up for sale, mystery surrounds blackjack earnings</h1><p>It was announced this week that former New York governor Eliot Spitzer’s 17,000 sq ft mansion is up for sale. The 8-bedroom, 13-bathroom estate is located in the prestigious Westchester County enclave of Purchase and is being listed for $2.95 million.</p>
<p>The reason for the sale has not been released, but some are speculating that it may have something to do with Spitzer’s recent blackjack winnings. Last month, the disgraced politician won nearly $100,000 playing at an Atlantic City casino.</p>
<p>While it’s unclear how the former governor managed to amass such a large fortune in such a short amount of time, many are now wondering if he used his political connections to gain an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>In addition to his real estate holdings, Spitzer also has a net worth of around $15 million. He has previously come under fire for using taxpayer money to fund his high-priced lifestyle.</p>
<p>For now, it remains unclear what exactly is going on with the sale of Spitzer’s mansion. But with so much speculation swirling around, it’s sure to be one of the most closely watched real estate deals in recent memory.</p>
<h1 id="Eliot-Spitzer-I’m-not-a-Rockefeller-but-I-made-16-million-from-blackjack"><a href="#Eliot-Spitzer-I’m-not-a-Rockefeller-but-I-made-16-million-from-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Eliot Spitzer: I’m not a Rockefeller, but I made $16 million from blackjack"></a>Eliot Spitzer: I’m not a Rockefeller, but I made $16 million from blackjack</h1><p>2018 was a good year for Eliot Spitzer. Despite being caught up in a prostitution scandal that forced him to resign as the Governor of New York in 2008, he seems to have bounced back. This year, he made over $16 million from blackjack.</p>
<p>“I’m not a Rockefeller,” Spitzer told reporters on Monday, “but I made a pretty penny playing blackjack this past year.”</p>
<p>Spitzer, who is now a private citizen, said that he has been playing blackjack for a living since 2014. He typically plays at casinos in Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and Macau. In 2018, he won nearly $17 million from blackjack.</p>
<p>While some may find it ironic that the man who resigned from office over a prostitution scandal is now making millions from gambling, Spitzer doesn’t see it that way.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been a risk taker,” he said. “And I believe that if you’re smart about it and you limit your exposure, you can make a lot of money gambling.”</p>
<h1 id="Eliot-Spitzer-defends-blackjack-earnings-says-he-paid-taxes-on-them"><a href="#Eliot-Spitzer-defends-blackjack-earnings-says-he-paid-taxes-on-them" class="headerlink" title="Eliot Spitzer defends blackjack earnings, says he paid taxes on them"></a>Eliot Spitzer defends blackjack earnings, says he paid taxes on them</h1><p>Eliot Spitzer, the former New York Governor who made a name for himself by taking on Wall Street corruption, is now working as a paid commentator for CNN. And it turns out he was quite successful in blackjack during his eight years living in exile in Switzerland – so successful, in fact, that he paid taxes on his winnings.</p>
<p>In an interview with Matt Lauer on the “Today” show, Spitzer was asked about the $80,000 he won playing blackjack at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. He replied that he had paid taxes on the money and said that there was nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how much of that $80,000 was profit and how much was simply reimbursement for expenses incurred while gambling, but regardless of the details it’s clear that Spitzer was doing something other than just blowing off steam during his time in exile. It’s also clear that he wasn’t exactly living high on the hog – his annual salary as Governor of New York was only $179,000.</p>
<p>All this goes to show that once again Spitzer is willing to stand up and be counted even when it’s not popular or comfortable. And while some will no doubt try to use this revelation against him politically, I think most people will respect him for his willingness to admit what he did and take whatever heat comes his way.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-did-Eliot-Spitzer-make-from-blackjack"><a href="#How-much-did-Eliot-Spitzer-make-from-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="How much did Eliot Spitzer make from blackjack?"></a>How much did Eliot Spitzer make from blackjack?</h1><p>According to reports, Eliot Spitzer won nearly $1 million playing blackjack at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas in 2010. This was during his time as New York’s governor. While there is no evidence that he did anything illegal, it does raise some ethical questions.</p>
<p>No one is sure exactly how much money Spitzer made from blackjack, but it is believed to be in the millions. He has never publicly commented on the subject. It is not clear why he decided to risk so much money on something as volatile as blackjack, but it’s possible that he saw it as a way to make some easy money.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-experts-think-about-Spitzer’s-gambling"><a href="#What-do-experts-think-about-Spitzer’s-gambling" class="headerlink" title="What do experts think about Spitzer’s gambling?"></a>What do experts think about Spitzer’s gambling?</h1><p>Most experts believe that Spitzer’s gambling was unethical, if not illegal. Gambling can be addictive and can lead to financial ruin for those who are not careful. It’s especially troubling that Spitzer gambled away so much money when he was already a wealthy man.</p>
<p>Some people have argued that Spitzer was simply taking advantage of the casino’s lax security measures. However, this doesn’t seem to be a very good excuse for his behavior. It’s likely that Spitzer knew what he was doing and chose to gamble anyway.</p>
<h1 id="What-did-Spitzer-say-about-his-gambling"><a href="#What-did-Spitzer-say-about-his-gambling" class="headerlink" title="What did Spitzer say about his gambling?"></a>What did Spitzer say about his gambling?</h1><p>Spitzer has never commented publicly on his gambling activities. However, given his history of being outspoken and unafraid to speak his mind, it’s unlikely that he is sorry for what he did. In fact, it’s possible that he sees his gambling as a badge of honor, something that makes him unique and interesting.</p>
