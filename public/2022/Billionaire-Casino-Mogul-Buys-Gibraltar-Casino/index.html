<p>The Victoria Casino is a small, family-owned casino with just 15 tables and 30 slot machines. It has been in operation since 1999 and has been owned by the same family since its inception.</p>
<p>Adelson, who is the founder, CEO, and chairman of Las Vegas Sands Corporation, is no stranger to the casino industry. His company operates The Venetian and The Palazzo Resorts in Las Vegas, as well as the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It is not yet known what Adelson plans to do with the Victoria Casino or if he will make any changes to it.</p>
<h1 id="California-Casino-Tycoon-Straub-Purchases-Gibraltar-Casino"><a href="#California-Casino-Tycoon-Straub-Purchases-Gibraltar-Casino" class="headerlink" title="California Casino Tycoon Straub Purchases Gibraltar Casino"></a>California Casino Tycoon Straub Purchases Gibraltar Casino</h1><p>Casino magnate and developer, Dr. Herbert J. Straub, has announced the purchase of the Gibraltar Casino in downtown Los Angeles. The acquisition, reported to be in the range of $325 million, is said to be one of the largest in California history.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled to have purchased Gibraltar,” Straub said in a statement released to the press. “This world-class casino is an incredible addition to my growing portfolio and I cannot wait to see it thrive under my direction.”</p>
<p>The Gibraltar Casino is a well-known and popular destination for gamblers in Southern California. The property includes a gaming floor with over 150 table games and 3,000 slot machines as well as restaurants, bars and a hotel.</p>
<p>According to reports, Straub plans on making significant investments in the property including upgrading the casino floor and expanding the hotel. He also intends to rename the casino to reflect his ownership.</p>
<p>“I am very excited about what the future holds for Gibraltar,” Straub said. “My goal is to make this one of the top casinos in the world and I look forward to welcoming everyone who visits here.”</p>
<p>Straub, who made his fortune developing casinos and resorts in California, recently announced his intention to retire from active business operations. The purchase of Gibraltar marks his final investment in the industry.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Springs-Casino-Owner-Buys-10-Straub-Casinos-in-Gibraltar"><a href="#Colorado-Springs-Casino-Owner-Buys-10-Straub-Casinos-in-Gibraltar" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Springs Casino Owner Buys 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar"></a>Colorado Springs Casino Owner Buys 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar</h1><p>Colorado Springs casino owner, John Verse, has made a huge purchase this week by acquiring 10 Straub casinos in Gibraltar. Gibraltar is a well-known gambling jurisdiction and is known for its strict licensing and regulatory procedures.</p>
<p>The Straub casinos are some of the most reputable in the industry and were known for their high levels of customer service and stringent safety and security measures. Gibraltar is also known for having some of the best online casinos in the world.</p>
<p>John Verse is no stranger to the gambling industry. He has been involved in running several Colorado Springs casinos over the years. His latest purchase will make him one of the leading casino owners in Gibraltar.</p>
<p>The Straub casinos have been under new ownership since they were purchased by Verse earlier this week. All 10 casino properties are now under the banner of John Verse Holdings Ltd.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Gaming-Magnate-Acquires-10-Straub-Casinos-in-Gibraltar"><a href="#Florida-Gaming-Magnate-Acquires-10-Straub-Casinos-in-Gibraltar" class="headerlink" title="Florida Gaming Magnate Acquires 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar"></a>Florida Gaming Magnate Acquires 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar</h1><p>Florida-based gaming mogul, Allan Fromberg, has announced the acquisition of 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar. The deal is said to be worth in the region of $350 million and is being seen as a major coup for Mr. Fromberg who already operates a number of casinos in both the United States and Europe. Gibraltar is seen as a key strategic location for casino expansion with its close proximity to southern Europe and North Africa.</p>
<p>The Straub casinos are well-known in Gibraltar for their high-quality gaming offerings and lavish facilities. Mr. Fromberg is said to be particularly keen on the properties’ Sky Sports betting lounge which offers some of the best in-play betting options in Europe. Commenting on the acquisition, Mr. Fromberg said:</p>
<p>“I am very excited about this deal and what it means for my company. The Straub casinos are top-notch operations with an outstanding reputation in Gibraltar. I am looking forward to bringing my experience and expertise to bear on these properties and making them even more successful.”</p>
<p>The acquisition marks another major move by Mr. Fromberg who has been making a concerted push into the European gambling market over the past few years. In addition to his interests in Florida and Gibraltar, he also has a number of casinos in Malta which have proven to be lucrative ventures. It is hoped that the latest acquisition will help him to continue this success and expand his presence into other key European markets.</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-Casino-Mogul-Buys-10-Straub-Casinos-in-Gibraltar"><a href="#Las-Vegas-Casino-Mogul-Buys-10-Straub-Casinos-in-Gibraltar" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas Casino Mogul Buys 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar"></a>Las Vegas Casino Mogul Buys 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar</h1><p><em>Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has purchased 10 Straub casinos in Gibraltar.</em></p>
<p>The deal, reportedly worth $1.2 billion, will give Adelson a presence in the British territory and make him one of the biggest casino operators on the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Straub Casinos are mid-market brands that are mostly found in Italy and Spain. The purchase gives Adelson a portfolio of 26 casinos.</p>
<p>Adelson already has a strong presence in Macau and is looking to expand further into Europe. The move comes as gambling revenues in Europe have been growing rapidly, thanks to rising tourist numbers.</p>
<p>Gibraltar is seen as a strategic location for Adelson as it offers easy access to both the UK and Spanish markets. The territory also has a low tax rate, which is attractive to casino operators.</p>
<p>Adelson is no stranger to controversy, having been involved in several high-profile lawsuits over the years. In recent months he has been locked in a legal battle with the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which he founded and currently chairs.</p>
