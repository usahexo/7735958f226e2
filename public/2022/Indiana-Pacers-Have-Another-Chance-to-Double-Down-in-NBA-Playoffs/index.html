            <h1 id="Indiana-Pacers-Have-Another-Chance-to-Double-Down-in-NBA-Playoffs"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers-Have-Another-Chance-to-Double-Down-in-NBA-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers Have Another Chance to Double Down in NBA Playoffs"></a>Indiana Pacers Have Another Chance to Double Down in NBA Playoffs</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers came into the 2018 NBA Playoffs as underdogs.</p>
<p>But, they have played well in the first round and now have a chance to take down the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference playoffs.</p>
<p>If the Pacers can prevail in this series, it would be a major upset and set up an intriguing matchup against the Boston Celtics or Milwaukee Bucks in the next round.</p>
<p>Indiana has been led by its All-Star guard Victor Oladipo, who is averaging 23 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists per game in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Oladipo has been helped by teammates Domantas Sabonis (14 points, 10 rebounds) and Bojan Bogdanovic (17 points), who have both played well in this series.</p>
<p>For Toronto, the key players have been DeMar DeRozan (24 points per game) and Kyle Lowry (19 points). However, the Raptors will need more from their other players if they want to advance to the next round.</p>
<p>In Tuesday’s Game 5 victory over Indiana, Jonas Valanciunas had 18 points and 14 rebounds for Toronto, while Pascal Siakam added 16 points. Serge Ibaka also scored 15 points for the Raptors.</p>
<p>This series is now tied at 2-2 heading back to Indianapolis for Game 5 on Thursday. If Toronto can’t win that game, they will likely have to win two straight games in order to advance.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Pacers-Get-Another-Opportunity-to-Double-Down-in-Vegas"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers-Get-Another-Opportunity-to-Double-Down-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers Get Another Opportunity to Double Down in Vegas"></a>Indiana Pacers Get Another Opportunity to Double Down in Vegas</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV - The Indiana Pacers were able to easily cruise past the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night to move on in the NBA Summer League tournament. This sets up a matchup with the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night, who have been very impressive in their first three games.</p>
<p>While most of the focus will be on the battle between LeBron James and Paul George, there are plenty of other intriguing matchups across the court. For the Pacers, it will be important to continue playing solid basketball as a team and not rely too much on any individual player.</p>
<p>If they can do that, they definitely have a chance to pull off an upset and move on to the semifinals. One player who could be key in that effort is rookie TJ Leaf. He had another solid game against Cleveland with 14 points and six rebounds.</p>
<p>Leaf has shown flashes of great potential early on in his NBA career and he will need to continue playing well if the Pacers want to make a deep run in Vegas. Another player who could be important is Edmond Sumner. He only played eight minutes against Cleveland due to foul trouble, but he has shown promise throughout the summer league so far.</p>
<p>Sumner is coming back from an ACL injury that cost him most of his rookie season, so it will be interesting to see how he performs as he continues to build up his minutes. If he can provide a spark off the bench, it would be a huge boost for the Pacers.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a very winnable game for Indiana and they should have plenty of confidence after beating Cleveland. If they play their best basketball, they have a good chance of knocking off the Lakers and moving on to the next round.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Pacers-Can’t-Miss-Another-Chance-to-Double-Down-on-Opponents"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers-Can’t-Miss-Another-Chance-to-Double-Down-on-Opponents" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers Can’t Miss Another Chance to Double Down on Opponents"></a>Indiana Pacers Can’t Miss Another Chance to Double Down on Opponents</h1><p>The Indiana Pacers are one of the most surprisingly good teams in the NBA this season. After trading away Paul George, many fans and analysts had them pegged to finish near the bottom of the Eastern Conference. However, they have managed to stay afloat largely thanks to the play of Victor Oladipo.</p>
<p>Oladipo has been putting up All-Star numbers this season, averaging 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. He has also been shooting incredibly efficiently, making over 48% of his field goal attempts and 41% of his three-point shots.</p>
<p>While Oladipo has been excellent this season, the Pacers have not been quite as good as their record would suggest. They have an inefficient offense that averages only 101 points per game (19th in the NBA) and a below average defense that gives up 107 points per game (22nd in the NBA).</p>
<p>Despite these deficiencies, the Pacers have still managed to win 21 games so far this season. This is largely due to their impressive ability to take advantage of opposing teams’ mistakes. They are currently first in the NBA in turnover percentage, averaging 16.2 turnovers per game.</p>
<p>This is a trend that they need to continue in order to make a playoff run. The Pacers are currently in eighth place in the Eastern Conference, but they are only two games ahead of ninth place Philadelphia 76ers. If they want to make sure they don’t miss out on the playoffs again this year, they need to take advantage of every opportunity they get to put their opponents away.</p>
<h1 id="When-Is-the-Best-Time-for-the-Indiana-Pacers-to-Double-Down"><a href="#When-Is-the-Best-Time-for-the-Indiana-Pacers-to-Double-Down" class="headerlink" title="When Is the Best Time for the Indiana Pacers to Double Down?"></a>When Is the Best Time for the Indiana Pacers to Double Down?</h1><p>It’s been a bit of a roller coaster season for the Indiana Pacers. They started off strong, but then they went on a massive losing streak in January. However, they’ve been on a bit of a winning streak recently, so it’s unclear as to whether they should buy or sell at the trade deadline this year.</p>
<h1 id="On-The-Sell-Side"><a href="#On-The-Sell-Side" class="headerlink" title="On The Sell Side"></a>On The Sell Side</h1><p>There are several reasons why the Pacers should consider selling at the trade deadline this year. To start with, their record is not as good as it was last year, and they are currently in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. Additionally, their best player, Victor Oladipo, is out for the season with a knee injury. This means that they are not in a good position to make a deep playoff run this year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the team could use some reinforcements and they are unlikely to get them through trades at this point in the season. There are some good players available on the trade market right now, but the Pacers would not be able to get prime talent without giving up key players like Myles Turner or Domantas Sabonis. As such, it makes more sense for them to sell at the trade deadline than to buy.</p>
<h1 id="On-The-Buy-Side"><a href="#On-The-Buy-Side" class="headerlink" title="On The Buy Side"></a>On The Buy Side</h1><p>Although there are several reasons why the Pacers should sell at the trade deadline this year, there are also some reasons why they should consider buying. To start with, their recent winning streak has shown that they are still capable of competing despite Victor Oladipo being out for the season. Additionally, teams who make deep playoff runs often have several key players who are injured during the playoffs. If the Pacers can get some reinforcements at the trade deadline this year, they may be able to make a deep playoff run even without Victor Oladipo.</p>
<p>Furthermore, their roster is relatively young and there is room for improvement. If they can add some quality players through trades at the deadline this year, they could become a force to be reckoned with in future seasons. As such, there is definitely merit to buying at the trade deadline this year despite their current struggles.</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-Pacers-Ready-to-Double-Down-in-Latest-Playoff-Game"><a href="#Indiana-Pacers-Ready-to-Double-Down-in-Latest-Playoff-Game" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Pacers Ready to Double Down in Latest Playoff Game"></a>Indiana Pacers Ready to Double Down in Latest Playoff Game</h1><p>Indiana Pacers are looking to claw their way back into their current playoff matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers. After dropping the first two games of the series at home, they now have to win four out of five if they want to move on. Luckily for them, the first two games were mostly close and gave them a chance to learn what they need to do in order to take down LeBron James and company.</p>
<p> Paul George is averaging over 28 points per game in the playoffs so far and will need to continue putting up big numbers in order for the Pacers to have a shot. Jeff Teague has also played well, averaging over 18 points and 7 assists per game. Myles Turner has been a pleasant surprise on defense, averaging nearly 2 blocks per game. If he can keep LeBron James somewhat under control, that will give Indiana’s offense a chance to thrive.</p>
<p>The Cavaliers are not without their own weapons, of course. Kyrie Irving is averaging nearly 27 points and 5 assists per game in the playoffs and LeBron James is always a threat to score 40 or more any night he steps on the court. Kevin Love has also been playing very well, averaging nearly 20 points and 10 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>Cleveland is definitely the favorite in this series, but Indiana still has a chance if they play well together and take advantage of every opportunity they get. Look for them to come out strong in Game 3 and give Cleveland everything they can handle.</p>
