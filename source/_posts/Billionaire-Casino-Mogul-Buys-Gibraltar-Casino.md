#  Florida Gaming Magnate Acquires 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar 

Florida-based gaming mogul, Allan Fromberg, has announced the acquisition of 10 Straub Casinos in Gibraltar. The deal is said to be worth in the region of $350 million and is being seen as a major coup for Mr. Fromberg who already operates a number of casinos in both the United States and Europe. Gibraltar is seen as a key strategic location for casino expansion with its close proximity to southern Europe and North Africa.

The Straub casinos are well-known in Gibraltar for their high-quality gaming offerings and lavish facilities. Mr. Fromberg is said to be particularly keen on the properties’ Sky Sports betting lounge which offers some of the best in-play betting options in Europe. Commenting on the acquisition, Mr. Fromberg said:

“I am very excited about this deal and what it means for my company. The Straub casinos are top-notch operations with an outstanding reputation in Gibraltar. I am looking forward to bringing my experience and expertise to bear on these properties and making them even more successful.”

The acquisition marks another major move by Mr. Fromberg who has been making a concerted push into the European gambling market over the past few years. In addition to his interests in Florida and Gibraltar, he also has a number of casinos in Malta which have proven to be lucrative ventures. It is hoped that the latest acquisition will help him to continue this success and expand his presence into other key European markets.

_Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has purchased 10 Straub casinos in Gibraltar._

The deal, reportedly worth $1.2 billion, will give Adelson a presence in the British territory and make him one of the biggest casino operators on the Mediterranean.

Straub Casinos are mid-market brands that are mostly found in Italy and Spain. The purchase gives Adelson a portfolio of 26 casinos.

Adelson already has a strong presence in Macau and is looking to expand further into Europe. The move comes as gambling revenues in Europe have been growing rapidly, thanks to rising tourist numbers.

Gibraltar is seen as a strategic location for Adelson as it offers easy access to both the UK and Spanish markets. The territory also has a low tax rate, which is attractive to casino operators.

Adelson is no stranger to controversy, having been involved in several high-profile lawsuits over the years. In recent months he has been locked in a legal battle with the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which he founded and currently chairs.
