#  In Sports Betting, - Means a Pending Bet

When you see a minus (-) sign next to a team's name in sports betting, it means that particular team is the underdog. In other words, they are not expected to win the game. For example, let's say the Rams are playing the 49ers. If you see -120 next to the Rams, it means they are the underdog and you would have to wager $120 in order to win $100. If you see +180 next to the 49ers, it means they are the underdog and you would win $180 for every $100 you wager.

Sports betting is one of the most popular ways of making money. The popularity of sports betting is increasing day by day. Millions of people are now investing in this industry and earning a lot of money.

Sports betting is a process in which you bet on the outcome of a sporting event. You can either bet on the winner or the loser. If you correctly predict the outcome, you will win and if you do not, you will lose your money.

Sports betting can be a very profitable business if done in the right way. However, you need to have some knowledge about sports and betting in order to make wise bets. You also need to have some patience as sports betting is not a quick way to make money.

There are different types of sports bets that you can place. The most common type of bet is the straight bet in which you bet on one team to win or lose. There are also other types of bets such as parlays, teasers and pleasers.

One thing that you need to keep in mind when betting on sports is that the odds are always against you. This means that even if you have a 50% chance of winning, you will still lose money in the long run if you keep betting on sports. This is because bookmakers always make a profit by taking into account the odds.

In order to improve your chances of winning, it is important to research about the teams and their players before placing any bets. You should also try to find out about the bookmakers' odds and how they work. This will help you make better bets and increase your chances of winning money.

#  In Sports Betting, - Means a Lost Bet

There's a reason why in sports betting, - means a lost bet. It's because when you place a bet, there's always a chance you could lose. No one is ever 100% sure of anything, and that goes for sports bets too.

However, that doesn't mean you can't win big if you do your research and make smart bets. In fact, there are plenty of sports fans out there who make a living off of betting on games.

If you're looking to get into sports betting, here are a few tips to help you get started:

1. Do Your Research

As with any other type of gambling, the key to winning money through sports betting is to do your research. This means studying the teams involved in the game, as well as looking at past results and trends.

2. Bet on Underdogs

One strategy for increasing your chances of winning is to bet on underdogs. This means picking teams that aren't expected to win, but have a good chance of pulling off an upset.

3. Use Multiple Bets

Another thing to keep in mind is that it's not always wise to put all your eggs in one basket. In other words, don't bet all your money on one game. Spread your bets out among several different games instead. This will help protect you against potential losses.

#  In Sports Betting, - Means an Unsettled Bet

In sports betting, a minus (-) sign preceding a team's point spread means that the team is the favorite and must win by more than the point spread for gamblers to win their bets. A plus (+) sign would mean that the team is an underdog and would need to lose by less than the point spread for gamblers to win their bets.

For example, in a football game where Team A is favored by 7 points, put simply -7 means Team A must win by more than 7 points for a gambler to win their bet, while +7 would mean that Team A must lose by less than 7 for a gambler to win their bet.

It's important to note that in cases where the point spread is not evenly divisible by two (2), such as in American football games where there are 3 points associated with a field goal rather than the traditional 1, then half-points are used. In this case, if Team A is favored by 7.5 points, then -7.5 would mean that Team A must win by more than 8 points for gamblers to win their bets.

#  In Sports Betting, - Means a Voidable Bet

When you see a minus (-) in front of a sports betting line, it usually means that the bet is "voidable." This means that the bet is not final and can be canceled by the sportsbook at any time.

For example, let's say you bet $100 on Team A to beat Team B. If Team A only wins by one point, the sportsbook may decide to void your bet. This means that you would lose your $100 wager, and wouldn't receive anything back.

However, if you bet on Team A to win by two points or more, your bet would likely stand even if they only won by one point. This is because the sportsbook would have a difficult time justifying voiding a bet that won outright.

There are other reasons why a sportsbook might void a bet, such as incorrect line setting or incorrect payout odds. But the most common reason is when the outcome of the game changes after the bet has been placed.
