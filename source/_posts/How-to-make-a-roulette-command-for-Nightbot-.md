#  How to make a roulette command for Nightbot 

This guide will show you how to create a Nightbot command which will allow users to play roulette.

First, we need to create the Nightbot command. We will name this command "roulette".

Next, we need to create a newNightbot function based on the Roulette theme. This function will take two input parameters: number and color. It will then randomly choose one of the two options and return the result.

function roulette(number, color) {     var result = ""; 
    if (number === 1 && color === "black") { result = "You win!"; } else if (number === 1 && color === "red") { result = "You lose!"; } else { result = "A draw!"; } 
    return result; }

Now we need to connect this function to our Nightbot command. We will do this by using the command's chat.exec() function. This function takes two input parameters: the first is the chat message, and the second is the Nightbot command that we want to run. In our case, it will be:

roulette("1", "black")

This will run our roulette function with the number 1 and the color black.

#  How to make a roulette wheel in Nightbot 

Many streamers use Nightbot to interact with their viewers and run different kinds of game shows. In this article, we will show you how to make a roulette wheel in Nightbot.

To create a roulette wheel in Nightbot, you first need to open theNightbot command editor. You can do this by clicking on the “Commands” tab on the left-hand side of the Nightbot dashboard and then selecting the “Editor” option.

Once you have opened the command editor, enter the following code into the text area:

!roulette()

This code tells Nightbot to run the roulette wheel game show.

If you want to customize the look and feel of your roulette wheel, you can do so by editing the following line of code:

 width: 600, height: 400, border: "5px solid black"

The width and height parameters control the size of your roulette wheel, while the border parameter controls its appearance. Feel free to experiment with different values until you find one that you like.

Once you have finished customizing your roulette wheel, click on the “Save” button and then activate it by clicking on the “Enabled” checkbox next to it. You are now ready to start playing!

#  How to create a custom Nightbot Roulette

This article will teach you how to create your own custom Nightbot Roulette game.

## What you need

In order to follow this guide, you'll need the following:

- A Nightbot account (https://www.nightbot.tv)
- A text editor or programming environment (e.g. Notepad++, Atom, Visual Studio Code)
- The Nightbot Roulette Discord server (https://discord.gg/jN8pcQK)
- A basic understanding of regular expressions and JavaScript

If you don't have a Nightbot account yet, go ahead and create one now. Once you're done, we can start creating our custom game.

## Creating the bot and adding commands

The first step is creating the bot itself. Open up your text editor or programming environment and create a new file. In this file, we'll write some basic Nightbot code to get our bot up and running. Here's what it should look like:

```nightbot
init() {
}

command(take_turn) {

}```


In the init() function, we'll set up some basic settings for our bot. We won't be doing anything in this function for now, so feel free to leave it as is. Next, we'll create our take_turn command. This command will be used to take turns playing our game. When someone issues this command, Nightbot will randomly choose one of the players to take their turn. Let's take a look at how this works:

First, we'll use the built-in Random module to choose a random number between 1 and 4 . This will give us a number from 1 to 4 , which we'll use as our index into an array containing the player names. Next, we'll use the regular expression ^[a-zA-Z]+$ to extract only the lowercase letters from our player name string. This will give us a single letter representing each player in our game. Finally, we'll use the Array slice function to select only the letter at position index . This will give us the letter that corresponds to the player that Nightbot has chosen to take their turn. We can then use this letter as part of an output message that tells the player what letter they've been assigned. Here's what everything looks like put together:
