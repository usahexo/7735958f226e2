#  Nevada Leads the Way in Online Gambling

Nevada is the first state in the United States to legalize online gambling. This move is seen as a way to bring in more revenue for the state, as well as to attract more tourists. Gambling has been legal in Nevada since 1931, and it is one of the main attractions for tourists who visit the state.

Nevada has been struggling financially in recent years, and online gambling is seen as a way to help address this issue. The new law allows people over 21 years of age to gamble online, and it will be regulated by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

Online casinos will be able to operate in Nevada as long as they are licensed by the state. There are already several operators who have applied for licenses, and it is expected that there will be many more applications in the coming months.

The move to legalize online gambling has been met with mixed reactions. Some people believe that it will lead to more problems with gambling addiction, while others see it as a way to generate more revenue for the state. There are also concerns that online gambling will be used by criminals and terrorists to launder money.

Despite these concerns, Nevada lawmakers believe that the benefits of legalizing online gambling outweigh the risks. They believe that it will help create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue for the state.

#  Delaware Cashes In on Online Gambling

Online gambling has been around for years, but it was not until Delaware legislatures passed a law in 2012 authorizing internet gambling did the industry take off in the state. A report released by the Delaware Department of Finance in January shows that the total revenue from gambling activities in the state reached $136 million in 2016, a 29 percent increase from the year before.

The main beneficiary of this growth has been Delaware’s three casinos, which raked in a combined $101 million in 2016, up from $84 million in 2015. The Casino at Delaware Park led the pack with $53 million in revenue last year, followed by Dover Downs Hotel & Casino ($34 million) and Harrington Raceway & Casino ($14 million).

While online gambling is thriving in Delaware, it has come at a cost to the state’s lottery system. The lottery generated $29 million in revenue in 2016, down from $35 million the year before. This decline is largely attributable to people shifting their spending from lottery tickets to online slots and other casino games.

Despite this drop, the overall trend is clearly upward for gambling revenues in Delaware, with online wagering now accounting for more than half of all casino gaming revenue in the state. This success is likely to continue as more and more people shift their entertainment dollars to internet-based options.

#  New Jersey Sees Increase in Online Gambling Revenue

According to a report released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, online gambling revenues in the state increased by nearly 28% in 2017. The report states that online gambling generated a total of $245 million in revenue last year, compared to $191 million in 2016.

The Division’s executive director, David Rebuck, said that the increase was due largely to the legalization of sports betting in New Jersey last year. He added that the state’s regulated online gambling market is “maturing” and becoming more competitive.

Sports betting accounted for approximately $184 million of New Jersey’s online gambling revenue in 2017, up from just $33 million in 2016. The other major sources of revenue were casino games (including poker) and slots, which brought in $38 million and $23 million respectively.

New Jersey has been at the forefront of the legal US online gambling industry since it was first legalized in 2013. The state’s casinos and racetracks were among the first to offer legal online gambling, and there are now dozens of venues offering a variety of games.

However, not all of New Jersey’s online casinos are created equal. Some operators have seen much greater success than others, with PokerStars claiming the lion’s share of the market. According to data from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming LLC, PokerStars accounted for more than 60% of New Jersey’s online poker revenue in 2017.

The runner-up was Pala Casino Online, which captured a little over 10% of the market. Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa came in third with 8%, while Caesars Interactive NJ had 5%. Other operators captured less than 5% each.

PokerStars is currently facing some competition from Foxwoods Online Casino, which launched its own poker site (powered by GAN) earlier this year. However, PokerStars is still well ahead of the competition and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

#  Pennsylvania Enters the Fray with Online Gambling

Pennsylvania has become the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling, following Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. The Keystone State enacted a law in October 2017 that allows residents to bet on casino games, horse races and sporting events through approved websites.

The law was cheered by the casino industry, which has seen its profits squeezed by the proliferation of casinos in other states. Pennsylvania has long been one of the most lucrative gambling markets in the country, with over $3 billion in annual revenue.

Online gambling is expected to bring an additional $200 million per year to state coffers. This will help offset a budget shortfall caused by declining tax revenue from traditional sources such as coal mining and natural gas drilling.

Critics charge that online gambling is addictive and can lead to financial ruin for those who cannot control their betting habits. Supporters argue that it is no different from playing poker or blackjack in a casino and that safeguards are in place to prevent problem gamblers from losing too much money.

Only adults over 21 years of age are allowed to participate in online gambling, and sites must be licensed by the state lottery commission. Players will be able to deposit money into their accounts using credit cards, electronic funds transfers or checks. Winnings will be paid out by check or transferred back into the player’s bank account.

The first sites are expected to go online in early 2018. Residents of Pennsylvania can already place bets on sports games through offshore websites, but these are not regulated or taxed by the state.

#  California Considers Regulating Online Gambling

In the aftermath of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a federal law that banned sports gambling, many states have been debating whether to legalize and regulate the activity. Now, California is considering doing the same for online gambling.

Assemblymember David Chiu introduced Assembly Bill 1677 earlier this year, which would allow licensed operators to offer online poker, blackjack, and other casino games to players in the state. The bill has been referred to the Assembly Committee on Governmental Organization, where it will be debated and possibly voted on.

Supporters of the bill argue that it would provide a new source of revenue for the state, as well as create jobs. They contend that it would be better to regulate and tax online gambling than to have it take place in an unregulated grey market.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction and social problems, and that it would be difficult to enforce age restrictions on players. They also say that it could cannibalize revenue from brick-and-mortar casinos.

If passed, AB 1677 would make California the latest state to legalize online gambling. New Jersey was the first state to do so, in 2013, followed by Nevada and Delaware. Pennsylvania recently became the fourth state to legalize online gambling when Governor Tom Wolf signed a bill into law in October.
