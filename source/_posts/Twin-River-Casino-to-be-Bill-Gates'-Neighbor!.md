#  Twin River Casino to be Bill Gates' Neighbor!

The news just broke and it's huge! Billionaire Bill Gates is buying a neighboring casino to Twin River in Lincoln, Rhode Island. Gates is already a big investor in the Twin River Casino, but this new purchase will make him one of its biggest landlords.

Why is Gates making this move? It seems that he sees the potential for enormous profits from the new East Coast gambling market. With his Neighbor purchase, Gates now has a dominant position in the Rhode Island casino market.

Gates isn't the only big name getting into the Rhode Island casino market. Caesars Entertainment is also making a big play with its purchase of the Narragansett Indian Tribe's casino. This is a strategic move by Caesars, as it looks to expand its Atlantic City presence.

So what does all of this mean for Twin River Casino? It means that the casino is facing some serious competition. With billionaires like Gates and Caesars getting into the game, Twin River will have to step up its game to stay competitive.

This could be good news for gamblers though. With more competition, the casinos are likely to offer better deals and bonuses to attract players. So if you're thinking of visiting Twin River Casino, now might be a good time to do so!
