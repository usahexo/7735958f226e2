#  How sports betting will benefit institutions and what to expect?

It’s no secret that legalized sports betting will provide a much-needed financial boost for cash-strapped colleges and universities. In fact, a 2017 study by the Eilers & Krejcik Gaming research firm found that U.S. collegiate athletic departments could bring in an additional $125 million annually if sports betting is legalized in all 50 states. The study also projects that NCAA football and men’s basketball would be the sports with the greatest growth potential for wagering, as they account for more than two-thirds of all illegal sports bets in the United States.

While it’s still too early to know exactly how much money individual schools will bring in from legal gambling, there’s no doubt that the financial impact will be significant. And with so many schools struggling to make ends meet, that extra revenue could be the difference between a winning and losing season.

But legalized sports betting won’t just benefit colleges and universities financially – it will also provide a number of other benefits. For example, it will help institutions attracts fans, sponsorships, and better athletes.

With legalized sports betting, that excitement will only increase as more people are able to place bets on their favorite teams. As a result, collegiate athletics is likely to see a surge in attendance – especially for major games and tournaments.

Sponsorships

Legalized gambling also has the potential to attract new sponsorships for colleges and universities. In fact, many companies are already eager to get involved in the industry, as they view it as an opportunity to reach out to a new audience of potential customers. With billions of dollars up for grabs, institutions can expect to see an influx of sponsorship deals from gaming companies, financial institutions, and other businesses looking to capitalize on the growing popularity of sports betting.
